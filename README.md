Welcome to my **Data Analytics & AI Certificate** repository. This space showcases my hands-on projects and learning journey as I build the skills required for entry-level roles in **data science** and **Python engineering**.

These projects will equip me with the foundational tools and real-world experience to break into the field.

### 🔧 What I’m Learning

#### ✅ Python Programming & Data Handling

* Mastering Python fundamentals for data work
* Using libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Regular Expressions** to clean, aggregate, and transform data
* Writing complex **SQL** queries to interact with databases
* Automating repetitive data tasks using Python scripts

#### ✅ Machine Learning Foundations

* Cleaning, encoding, and balancing data for modeling
* Building and training models using **scikit-learn**
* Evaluating model performance and iterating for improvements

#### ✅ Data Visualization & Dashboards

* Creating charts and plots using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**
* Building interactive dashboards with **Dash**
* Communicating insights effectively through data storytelling

### 🎓 Real-World Projects & Mentorship

Each project in this repo is designed to simulate real business problems—whether it’s predicting outcomes, analyzing trends, or building tools to support decision-making. I’ve also received mentoring and feedback throughout this program to strengthen both technical skills and job-readiness.

 

### 🚀 Goals

* Build a strong portfolio to showcase my skills to employers
* Gain confidence using Python, SQL, AI and ML tools in real-world scenarios
* Transition into a **data analyst**, **data scientist**, or **Python engineer** role
