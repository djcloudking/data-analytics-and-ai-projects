# **Data Analytics, ML & AI Projects**


This repository showcases my hands-on projects and learning journey as I build the skills required for **Data Analytics, ML & AI Certificate**.

These projects will equip me with the foundational tools and real-world experience of **Data Analytics, Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence** field.


### ðŸ”§ What Iâ€™m Learning

#### âœ… SQL (& PostgreSQL)



#### âœ… Python Programming & Data Handling

* Mastering Python fundamentals for data work
* Using libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Regular Expressions** to clean, aggregate, and transform data
* Writing complex **SQL** queries to interact with databases
* Automating repetitive data tasks using Python scripts

#### âœ… Machine Learning Foundations

* Cleaning, encoding, and balancing data for modeling
* Building and training models using **scikit-learn**
* Evaluating model performance and iterating for improvements

#### âœ… Data Visualization & Dashboards

* Creating charts and plots using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**
