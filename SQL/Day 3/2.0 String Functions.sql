-------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WARMUPS & REFERENCE
-------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. Converting Case:
--    SELECT UPPER(tags) 
--    FROM products;


----------------------------------
-- 2. Get Part of a String:
--    Get first 5 characters of the zipcode
/*
      SELECT
         ship_zipcode, 
         SUBSTRING(ship_zipcode,1,5)
      FROM orders;
*/

--    Get the last 4 characters of the zipcode (after the -)
/*
       SELECT
          ship_zipcode, 
          SUBSTRING(ship_zipcode,7,4)
       FROM orders;
*/



----------------------------------
-- 3. PostgreSQL Only: Splitting Strings:
--    Get the first part of the split string:
/*
      SELECT
         ship_zipcode,
         SPLIT_PART(ship_zipcode,'-',1)
      FROM orders;
*/

--    Get the second part of the split string:
/*
      SELECT
         ship_zipcode,
         SPLIT_PART(ship_zipcode,'-',2)
      FROM orders;
*/



----------------------------------
-- 4. Other Ways to Split Strings:

--    Get the first 5 characters (starting from the left)
/*
      SELECT
         ship_zipcode,
         LEFT(ship_zipcode, 5)
      FROM orders;
*/



--    Get the last 4 characters (starting from the right).
--    This does get the right-most 4 characters, 
--    but it's not the 4 characters to the right of the dash.
/*
      SELECT
         ship_zipcode,
         RIGHT(ship_zipcode, 4)
      FROM orders;
*/



--    If the zipcode has more than 5 characters,
--    then get the right 4 characters, otherwise return an empty string
--    PostgreSQL:
/*
      SELECT
         ship_zipcode,
         CASE
            WHEN LENGTH(ship_zipcode) > 5 THEN RIGHT(ship_zipcode, 4)
            ELSE ''
         END
      FROM orders;
*/


--    SQL Server Only:
/*
      SELECT
         ship_zipcode,
         IIF( LEN(ship_zipcode) > 5, RIGHT(ship_zipcode, 4), '')
      FROM orders;
*/



/******************************************************/
-- SQL Server
/******************************************************/

--  SQL Server: Get the number of a character's location within a string
/*
      SELECT
         email, 
         CHARINDEX('@', email)
      FROM users
      ORDER BY 2;
*/

-- SQL Server: Get everything starting from the left, up to that character location
/*
      SELECT
         email,
         LEFT( email, CHARINDEX('@', email) )
      FROM users;
*/

-- SQL Server: Subtract 1 to omit the @ character
/*
      SELECT
         email,
         LEFT( email, CHARINDEX('@', email) -1 )
      FROM users;
*/

-- SQL Server: Use a substring to grab from the @ character to the end of the email
-- We use 255 for the length because this column only accepts up to 255 characters
-- so we know that's plenty of characters (it's OK for the length to be more than you need)
/*
      SELECT
         email,
         SUBSTRING( email, CHARINDEX('@', email) + 1, 255 )
      FROM users;
*/


--------------------------------------------------------
-- EXERCISES: Answer using the techniques from above.
--------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. Create a list of the unique email domain names (the gmail.com, yahoo.com part) for all users.
SELECT distinct split_part(email, '@', 2) AS EmailDom, count(*) FROM users u
GROUP BY EmailDom

-- 2. How many users have each email domain name?
SELECT
   SPLIT_PART(email,'@',2) as email_domain,
   COUNT(*)
FROM users
GROUP BY email_domain;
