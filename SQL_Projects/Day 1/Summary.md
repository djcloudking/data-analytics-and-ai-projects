# What I Learned Today


SQL Query Written Order
 
SELECT: Specify the columns to show in result set

DISTINCT: Eliminate duplicate rows

TOP (SQL Server): Limit the returned data to a specific number of rows

FROM: Get the base data from a table

JOIN: Obtain data from another table

WHERE: Filter unwanted rows from the result set

GROUP BY: Aggregate the base data (collect into groups)

HAVING: Filter unwanted rows from the grouped data

ORDER BY: Sort the final data

LIMIT (Postgres): Limit the returned data to a specific number of rows

Other SQL query I saw:

DESC: Ordering by descending order (from recent to old)

ASC: Ordering by ascending order (from old to recent)
