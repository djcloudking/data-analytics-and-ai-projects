## LIKE and Wildcards

1. Filter with wildcard: 
    SELECT name, user_city FROM users
    WHERE user_city LIKE '%port%';


2a. Case sensitivity in PostgreSQL:
    LIKE is case sensitive
    ILIKE is case insensitive
    SELECT name, user_city FROM users
    WHERE user_city ILIKE '%port%';


2b. Case sensitivity in SQL Server:
SQL Server is case insensitive by default.
Case sensitivity is defined by the column, not the SQL statement.

Check a table's case sensitivity for all columns:

SELECT table_name, column_name, collation_name
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE table_name = 'users'; --put your table name in the single quotes

SQL Server case sensitive query:

SELECT name, user_city FROM users
WHERE user_city LIKE '%port%' COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CS_AS;


3. Filter using AND:
In PostgreSQL:
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE title ILIKE '%paper%' AND price > 30;

In SQL Server:
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE title LIKE '%paper%' AND price > 30;


4. Filter using OR:
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE ship_state = 'FL' OR ship_zipcode = '17408';


5. Filter using NOT: 
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE NOT tags = 'emerald';
