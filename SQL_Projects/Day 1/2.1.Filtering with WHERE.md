## Filtering with WHERE


 1. Filter by exact value:
    SELECT * FROM products
    WHERE price = 31.98;

 2. Filter with less-than:
    SELECT * FROM products
    WHERE price < 31.98;


 3. Filter with a range (using BETWEEN): 
    SELECT * FROM products
    WHERE price BETWEEN 28.87 AND 44.93;


  4. Filter with multiple conditions (using OR): 
    SELECT * FROM products
    WHERE price = 31.98
    OR price= 28.87;


5. Filter with set of values (using IN): 
Does the same thing as the previous OR statement, but with less code.
    SELECT * FROM products
    WHERE price IN (31.98, 28.87);
